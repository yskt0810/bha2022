## Motivations

I was enjoy the BioHack Academy 2022 both online lectures and workshops at Bioclub Tokyo. I learnd so much about knowledges, skills and literacies of Biohack in local labs and in my home. 

However, I have not good at how to "apply" biohack to my life. How can I use those skills to make our life better or happier? Or those biohack knowledges and skills could use for what? Those are what I will seek from now on, and I need to make my own Bio hack environment in my home (because there are not so much time that I will come to the lab). "Building DIY Biohack environment in my home" is my basic motivation for my final project. 

And, as the first step of this project, I decided to make an microscope with mobilizing my knowledge and skills of digital fabrication.
