## Motivations

I was enjoy the BioHack Academy 2022 both online lectures and workshops at Bioclub Tokyo. I learnd so much about knowledges, skills and literacies of Biohack in local labs and in my home. 

However, I have not good at how to "apply" biohack to my life. How can I use those skills to make our life better or happier? Or those biohack knowledges and skills could use for what? Those are what I will seek from now on, and I need to make my own Bio hack environment in my home (because there are not so much time that I will come to the lab). "Building DIY Biohack environment in my home" is my basic motivation for my final project. 

And, as the first step of this project, I decided to make an microscope with mobilizing my knowledge and skills of digital fabrication.

## Bill of Materials

To make a Fab Hack Microscope, we need to buy those items.

## Design and 3D Printing


### Body of Microscope

Use wrap core as a main body of the microscope, then modelling and printing adapters of the an eyepiece webcam and a objective lens.

Designing by Fusion 360:

Then, printed and assembled.

### Desiging Objective Lens

We can make our own objective lens by using two convex lens. Here, I make it by using this f65 13mm convex lens.



### Z-Axis Mechanism
ã€€
The most important part of desiging in 1st version is a mechanism of Z-axis up/down with holding the body of microscope that assembled Eyepiece Webcam and Objective Lens. I used a NEMA Stepper motor for controlling up/down and designed with inspiring from [the mechanism of 3D Printer Z-axis](https://forum.duet3d.com/topic/16486/choosing-a-z-axis-style/9).

Here is the Fusion 360 view:
