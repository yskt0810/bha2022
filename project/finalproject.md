### Project Memo: What I want to do.

- Making a home biohack kits with digital fabrication... 
    - microscope
    - PCR
- 遺伝子解析 Genetic Analysis
- Biosensing
    - 簡単なバイオセンサーを作ってArduinoか何かで計測

### Breain Storming...

I am still not good at what I can do with biohacking.... However, I have not so much go to the lab.... 
Also, I am a person from digital fabrication, Fab Lab, Fab Academy.

So, I wanna make some DIY Biohack machines to "play" biohacking in my home or the lab except bio lab.

- Make machines listted biohack repositories: https://github.com/biohackacademy
    - revising the BoM and Hardware and Software Architectures with Supply Chain in Japan.
- install softwares for biohacking
- Do experiments something with using those machines
    - Generic Analysis of myself

Ideal.... Can I do Genetic Analysis or Bio Sensing with using those machine...?? 

Realistic Target:  Introduce as one topic of Wildcard Week in Fab Academy 

I wish this would be continue as my DIY Bio-Fab Project later.... 

Biohack+ WiFi Chip. 
Lab Automation.

- Search Pocket PCR and revise it.
- Waseda Lab: What is used, what does not make sense in DIY.
