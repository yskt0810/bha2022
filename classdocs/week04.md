## Growthing Medium

We start our lab activities. This week, we make a growth medium (culture medium) by gelrite. Grouwh medium is to support the growth of a population of microorganisums or cells.

### Prepare materials and machines

Here is a materials for making a growth mediums

Gelrite ... 4g. We use the gelrite in the lab.

Pure Water ... 500ml. Also, we have a small tank for storing it.

Those are machines that we use in our lab.

- magnetic stirrer to mix pure water and galrite.

### Procedures

First, measure 500ml pure water in a beaker.

Then, put pure water into one bottle.

We use a magnetic stirrer to mix pure water and gelrite later, so we put the magnet into the bottle.

Measure 4g gelrite by digital scaler.

Start mixing....

If not well mixed, it is better to shake the bottle....

After mixed and shaked, we close the cap. Not close the cap tightly, a little bit loosen.
