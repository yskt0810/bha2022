PCR by Bento Lab.

We tried PCR experiment by Bento Lab.

This time, we tried PCR Extraction from Saliva. The instruction of this experiment by Bento Lab is [here](https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/dna-extraction-from-saliva/).

### Micro-pipette Excersize

First, we excisize the use of micro-pipette. Micro-pipette is very useful to take so little amount of liquid materials. The features of micro-pipette are:

- set dials for decide how much (maximum) liquid materials to take
- Button have two stages to completely push out the liquid materials.

In our lab, there are two types of micro-pipettes. This is for 20-200 ul.

Also, this is for 2-20ul.

This is a practices of how to use micro-pipette.

### Gathering Saliva

To gather the saliva, I used salt water as a mouthwash to collect my cheek cells. Pour the salt water into my mouth, then I rinses my inner cheeks vigorously for 30 - 60 seconds. After that, I spitted the saline solution into a new glass.

After gathering saliva (cheek cells), I moved it into the microcengrifuge tubes.

### Centrifuge

Now, I will try to use centrifuge of Bento Lab. It use gravitational force to concentrate the sample. 

I set the micro-tube into the centrefuge. The important point is to balance the centrifuge with another sample or with another counter weight. If we set only two micro-tubes, we shold put them with keeping the balances on the centrifuge.

Once the micro-tubes is set with balance in the centrifuge roter, close the lid and activate the centrifuge module. Then, set the following...

- Speed: 4,000G
- spin for 90 seconds.

Then, start the centrifuge roter. The demonstration is here:

### Recovering the Pellet

After finishing centrifugation, we can see a pellet at the bottom of the micro-tube. This is the cheek cells concentrated in a small white ball. (Remaining liquid is called the supernatant.).
