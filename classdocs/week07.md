This time, we tried PCR Extraction from Saliva. The instruction of this experiment by Bento Lab is [here](https://bento.bio/protocol/biotechnology-101/dna-extraction-from-saliva/).

### Micro-pipette Excersize

First, we excisize the use of micro-pipette. Micro-pipette is very useful to take so little amount of liquid materials. The features of micro-pipette are:

- set dials for decide how much (maximum) liquid materials to take
- Button have two stages to completely push out the liquid materials.

In our lab, there are two types of micro-pipettes. This is for 20-200 ul.

Also, this is for 2-20ul.

### Gathering Saliva

To gather the saliva, I used salt water as a mouthwash to collect my cheek cells. Pour the salt water into my mouth, then I rinses my inner cheeks vigorously for 30 - 60 seconds. After that, I spitted the saline solution into a new glass.
